# Svelte-Laravel-CRUD

This is a identical project to my [Svelte-NextJs-CRUD](https://github.com/busyxiang/Svelte-NestJs-CRUD) but using Laravel as my backend framework instead.

## Run Application

You would need two terminals in order to run both frontend and backend at the same time in this projects.

### Backend Terminal

```bash
$ cd ./laravel-backend
$ php artisan serve
```

### Frontend Terminal

```bash
$ cd ./svelte-frontend
$ npm run dev
```
